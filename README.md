# Powdery Mildew detector in Cherry leaves

Mildew detection in Cherry leaves is a streamlit dashboard app that uses Machine Learning to produce a prediction model where the client can upload images of cherry leaves and a report is produced to indicate if those leaves contain powdery Mildew or not.


This app also visualises the cherry leaf data and compares healthy cherry leaves to cherry leaves containing powdery mildew in the following ways:
- Creating both an average image and a variability image for both healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves containing powdery mildew.
- An image montage where the client can select from either the 'healthy' label or the 'powdery mildew' label from a drop down list and a montage of images are produced to compare images from both labels.
